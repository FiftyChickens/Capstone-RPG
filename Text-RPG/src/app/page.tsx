          A dragon has risen, casting a shadow of fear across the land. No one
          knows where it came from or why it has emerged now, but its
          destruction grows with each passing day. The people are helpless, and
          no hero has dared to face itâ€”until now.

          This is your moment. The dragon&apos;s trail is faint, but the clues

          origins, track its movements, and prepare for the ultimate battle. The
          fate of the land rests on your shoulders alone.
