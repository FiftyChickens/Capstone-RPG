Text RPG: Idea Picked

A game that uses buttons to prompt the user where to go or what to do.

this website would use an API I made to for locations, monsters, and items.

The map will be set and the same for all users,
however the monsters at the locations will be random.

when beating the game, the speed will be posted to a leaderboard.



Where to watch: 

Create an easy-to-use platform where users can enter the title of any
movie or TV show to instantly see where itâ€™s available for streaming

use API's for popular streaming sites or make one if free versions are not available

allow users to save shows they have watched and plan to watch.
